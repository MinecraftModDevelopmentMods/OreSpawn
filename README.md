# MMD OreSpawn

OreSpawn 4 is a provider-driven world-generation engine for Minecraft 1.21.1.
It gives mods and modpacks one place to configure ores, deposit shapes, optional
rock strata and geomes, provider-owned underground fluid deposits, biome
palettes and world materials, flat bedrock, and bounded ore retrogen.

Its OS3 compatibility layer preserves ranged legacy block budgets, exclusive
legacy height ceilings, and the historical "all dimensions except Nether and
End" policy used by mods such as Base Metals.

This is not the unrelated mod that adds mobs and dimensions under the same
name.

## What Happens When It Is Installed?

OreSpawn is deliberately passive on its own. It does not replace stone, remove
vanilla ores, or change the Nether merely because the jar is installed. A
provider mod or a modpack profile must opt features in.

Mineralogy 6 is the first full provider. It supplies its rocks, ores, crude-oil
deposit, geomes, biome influences, and recommended settings to OreSpawn. An
ore-only provider such as Base Metals can supply ores and host tags without
enabling rock layers or biome replacement. A total-conversion provider can add
biomes and replace surfaces, aquifer fluids, snow, and ice through OreSpawn's
declarative provider contract.

## Players And Server Owners

When a provider exposes world settings, use **OreSpawn...** on the Create World
screen. **Recommended Defaults** restores the settings supplied by the
installed mods and pack. The in-game **Help & Guide** explains the controls.

Important files:

| Location | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `config/orespawn-worldgen.json` | Defaults for newly created worlds |
| `<world>/serverconfig/orespawn-worldgen.json` | Complete settings snapshot for one world |
| `config/<modid>-orespawn.json` | Optional modpack override for one provider |
| `config/orespawn-guide/README.md` | Guide exported automatically on first load |

Profile edits affect newly generated chunks. Ore and flat-bedrock retrogen are
separate opt-in features; OreSpawn never retro-generates rock strata.

To move a configured single-player world to a dedicated server, copy the
world's `serverconfig/orespawn-worldgen.json` with the world and install the
same provider mods on the server.

## Mod And Modpack Integration

Mods can provide declarative rules in either of these ways:

- package `data/<modid>/orespawn/provider.json` in the mod jar;
- call `OreSpawnApi.enqueue(WorldgenProvider)` during `InterModEnqueueEvent`.

Modpacks can override a provider with `config/<modid>-orespawn.json`. A present
override is authoritative and fails closed when invalid, so a broken pack file
cannot silently disable another mod's native ore generation.

Only `zone.moddev.mc.orespawn.api` is supported Java API. API major version `1`
is also recorded in the jar manifest as `OreSpawn-API-Version`.

Start with:

- [Player guide](docs/PLAYER_GUIDE.md)
- [Developer guide](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)
- [Configuration reference](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)
- [Provider JSON guide](docs/PROVIDERS.md)
- [Java API guide](docs/API.md)
- [Biome and world-material guide](docs/BIOMES.md)
- [Schemas and examples](docs/README.md)

The full documentation bundle is packaged under `META-INF/orespawn/docs/` and
exported to `config/orespawn-guide/` without overwriting existing files.

## Building

Use Java 21 from the repository root:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat test processResources build javadoc --no-daemon
.\gradlew.bat genEclipseRuns eclipse --no-daemon
```

Machine-specific `AGENTS.md` and `agent-notes/` files are intentionally ignored.
Public developer and AI integration guidance lives in `docs/` and is included
in the built jar.
